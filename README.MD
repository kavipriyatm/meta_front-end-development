# Meta Front-End Developer Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This project is the capstone for the Meta Front-End Developer course. It was developed using core front-end technologies—**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—without the use of frameworks like React or libraries like Bootstrap.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to design, develop, and deploy a functional and responsive front-end web application. The project focuses on building a smooth user experience and practicing modern development standards.
